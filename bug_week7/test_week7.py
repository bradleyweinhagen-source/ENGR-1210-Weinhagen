# test_week7.py
# TEST CASES — Week 7
#
# HOW TO RUN THESE TESTS:
#   Open the VS Code terminal (Ctrl+`)
#   Make sure you are in the same folder as bug_week7.py
#   Type: python test_week7.py
#   Press Enter.   (Or just open this file and click Run.)
#
# Nothing to install — this is a plain Python file.
#
# HOW A TEST WORKS:
#   Every test does the same three things:
#     1. CALL a function from bug_week7 with inputs you choose.
#     2. Write down the answer you EXPECT.
#     3. Use if / elif / else to compare them and print the verdict.
#
#   result   = bug_week7.apply_discount(50.00, 20)
#   expected = 40.00
#
#   if result == expected:
#       print("   PASS")
#   elif result is None:
#       print("   FAIL - got None. Is a return statement missing?")
#   else:
#       print("   FAIL - expected", expected, "but got", result)
#
# READING THE OUTPUT:
#   PASS  <- the function gave back exactly what we expected
#   FAIL  <- the function gave back something else.
#            The line tells you what you expected and what you got.
#   TODO  <- a test you haven't written yet
#
# YOUR JOB THIS WEEK:
#   Tests 1-6 are fully written — study them as examples.
#   Tests 7-9 are STUBS — fill them in using the same pattern.
#   Test 10 is MISSING — write the whole function from scratch.
#
# ============================================================
# WHAT MAKES A GOOD TEST CASE? (running list)
#   first    — first item / lowest input
#   middle   — typical input in the middle
#   last     — last item / highest input
#   missing  — input not in the data
#   edge     — unusual but valid (empty string, zero, spaces)
#   boundary — exact value where behavior changes
#   empty    — empty list, empty string, zero quantity
#
# For each stub below, think about which category of test case
# would be most valuable to write.
# ============================================================


# ============================================================
# IMPORT — the doorway between the two files
#
# bug_week7.py is a MODULE: just a .py file in the same folder.
# This line runs bug_week7.py once and gives us access to
# everything inside it. We call its functions with the module
# name in front:
#
#     bug_week7.format_student("ada", "lovelace", "A001")
#
# The demo code at the bottom of bug_week7.py does NOT run here,
# because it sits inside  if __name__ == "__main__":

# MISSING TEST (TEST 10) — Write this one entirely from scratch.
#
# There is NO stub. You write the whole thing: the def line,
# the print line, the calls, and the if / elif / else.
#
# What to test: build_roster() called TWICE with no student list.
# Each call should start FRESH — the second call should know
# nothing about the first.
#
# Your test must:
#   1. Call bug_week7.build_roster("Python")   (ignore the result)
#   2. Call bug_week7.build_roster("Circuits") and save it in result
#   3. The second result should look exactly like a first call:
#          expected = {"Circuits": ["(enrolled)"]}
#   4. Compare with if / elif / else and print PASS or FAIL.
#
# Name it:  test_build_roster_twice
# Then go to the bottom of the file and UN-COMMENT the line
# that runs it.
#
# Test case category: STATEFUL (new!) — it needs TWO calls,
# because it checks whether one call affects the next.
# ============================================================

# Write your test here:
def test_build_roster_twice():
    print("\nTEST 10 (stateful): build_roster() called twice")
    bug_week7.build_roster("Python")

#   TEST 4   PASS
#   TEST 5   PASS
#   TEST 6   PASS
