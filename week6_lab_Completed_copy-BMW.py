# ENGR1210 — Morse Code Translator Project
# Week 6 Lab: User Input and while Loops
# Chapter 7 — Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition
#
# Standalone script — the LAST week before "The Great Refactor."
# Still no functions and no imports. New tools: input() and while loops.
# This week your translator becomes INTERACTIVE, and you start turning
# measured signal durations back into dots, dashes, and gaps.
#
# NOTE: this file asks for keyboard input, so RUN it (F5) and type at the
# prompts. Type 'quit' to leave the loop.
# =============================================================================

# --- Carried forward: build both lookup dictionaries from the codebook -------

# loop body becomes a clean function call.)

# -- ANCHOR QUESTIONS ------------------------------------------------------
# Q1. What is the 'sentinel' value here, and what would happen if we forgot
#     the break? (Careful — that's an infinite loop. Use Ctrl+C to escape.)
# The sentinel value is quit, and if we forget to add break, the loop will go on forever.

# Q2. Why do we check text.lower() == 'quit' instead of text == 'quit'?
# In case someone capitalizes quit, otherwise they would not be seen as the same.

# Q3. input() always returns a string. Why does that matter the moment you
#     ask the user for a NUMBER (see the GUIDED section)?
#This matters because input() returns a string, so the code needs to convert it to an int() to use it as a number. Otherwise, it could cause an error when doing math with it.

#     3) Quit
# 
# Use a while loop with input() and an if/elif/else on the menu choice.
# Re-show the menu after each action.
#
#   ENCODE: upper-case the text, then loop each character. Look it up with
#           ENCODE_MAP.get(char, '?'); use '/' for a space. Join with spaces.
#   DECODE: split the typed Morse on spaces into tokens, then loop them. Look
#           each token up with DECODE_MAP.get(token, '?'); turn '/' back into
#           a space. Join the letters together.

print("=" * 52)

# Ask the user "How many times should I repeat the message?" and keep
# asking until they enter a valid whole number greater than 0.
#   - input() returns a string; you'll need int() to convert it.
#   - A bad entry like "five" will CRASH int() with a ValueError. Instead of
#     pre-screening the text, wrap the conversion in a try / except block:
#     try to int() it, and if it raises ValueError, print a message and let
#     the loop ask again. Only break once you have a whole number > 0.
#   - Once you have a valid count, encode a fixed message and print its
#     Morse that many times.
#
# Reflect in a comment: this is a "validation loop." Why is catching the error
# with try / except safer than trusting the first thing the user types?
#
# Hint (the shape, not the answer): wrap the risky int() in try, break only
# after you've confirmed the value is > 0, and handle the except ValueError.

# TODO: implement the validation loop here


# =============================================================================
# CHECKLIST
#   [x] ANCHOR:    typed messages; 'quit' exits cleanly; answered Q1-Q3
#   [x] GUIDED:    pulses classify as dot/dash; gaps as symbol/letter/word
#   [x] EXTENSION: menu ENCODES and DECODES; Quit exits the loop
#   [ ] STRETCH:   (optional) numeric input is validated before use
#   [x] I noticed how many times I copy-pasted the encoding loop
#
# LOOKING AHEAD — Week 7: THE GREAT REFACTOR
#   You now have a WORKING translator — but the same encoding loop is
#   copy-pasted in several places, and everything lives in one giant file.
#   Next week you learn FUNCTIONS. You'll wrap each piece of logic in a
#   function, split the project into MODULES (separate .py files), and meet
#   the hardware layer that finally turns "[LED]" print lines into a real
#   blinking LED you can run on a Pi Pico. Keep ALL your week 1-6 files.
