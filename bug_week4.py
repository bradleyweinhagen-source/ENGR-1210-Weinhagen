# BUG OF THE WEEK - Week 4: if Statements   (Test-Case Edition)
# =============================================================================
# This file has FOUR bugs. Every one of them RUNS without crashing and prints
# something -- which is exactly the trap. "It ran" does not mean "it works."
#
# You find these bugs the way engineers really do: with TEST CASES.
# A test case is just a known INPUT plus the OUTPUT you EXPECT for it.
# Run the code, compare the ACTUAL output to what you expected, and every
# mismatch is a bug.
#
# The sneaky part: some bugs are only wrong for CERTAIN inputs. A section can
# look perfect on the first value you try and be broken on the next. That is
# why you test several cases -- especially BOUNDARIES (a number right on a
# cutoff) and EDGE CASES (odd capitalization, a value that isn't in a list).
#
# HOW TO WORK THROUGH IT
#   1. Run the file. Each section prints its result for every test input.
#   2. Go to that section's TEST CASE TABLE and fill in ACTUAL, then PASS/FAIL.
#   3. Each FAIL points at the bug. Fix the code, re-run, and confirm every
#      row now PASSES.
#   4. Add at least TWO of your own test cases to each list -- try to find an
#      input the table did not already cover.
#   5. For Bug 3, practice the VS Code debugger: put a breakpoint on the first
#      'if', Step Over (F10), and WATCH which branch runs.

# BUG 2 - User Check

# =============================================================================
# WHEN YOU ARE DONE
#   [ ] Every table has ACTUAL filled in and PASS/FAIL marked
#   [ ] You added at least two of your own test cases to each section
#   [ ] You fixed each bug and re-ran until every row PASSES
#   [ ] For each bug you can say (a) which test case exposed it and
#       (b) why the original code was wrong
