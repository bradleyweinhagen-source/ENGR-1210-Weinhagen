# The codebook maps each letter to its Morse pattern. This week we don't
# have dictionaries yet (those are Week 5) or loops (Week 3), so we store
# the data in TWO PARALLEL LISTS that line up by position:
#
#     letters[0] is 'A'   and   patterns[0] is '.-'
#     letters[1] is 'B'   and   patterns[1] is '-...'
#
# The lists MUST stay in the same order. Position is the only thing
# connecting a letter to its pattern. (Hold onto that thought — it's
# fragile, and it's exactly why Week 5's dictionary will be a relief.)

letters  = ['A',  'B',    'C',    'D',   'E']
patterns = ['.-', '-...', '-.-.', '-..', '.']

print(f"\nThe codebook currently has {len(letters)} letters.")
print(f"First letter:  {letters[0]}  ->  {patterns[0]}")
print(f"Last letter:   {letters[-1]}  ->  {patterns[-1]}")   # -1 = last item

# -- Looking up a pattern by letter (no loop needed) -----------------------
# .index() finds WHERE a value sits in a list. We use the letter's
# position in 'letters' to grab the matching slot in 'patterns'.
c_position = letters.index('C')        # where is 'C'? -> 2
c_pattern  = patterns[c_position]      # same slot in the other list
print(f"\nLooking up 'C': it is at position {c_position}, pattern is '{c_pattern}'")

# -- Growing the codebook with append() ------------------------------------
letters.append('F')
patterns.append('..-.')
print(f"After adding F: {len(letters)} letters, last is {letters[-1]} -> {patterns[-1]}")

# -- ANCHOR QUESTIONS ------------------------------------------------------
# Q1. Why must 'letters' and 'patterns' stay in exactly the same order?
#     What breaks if you append to one list but forget the other?
#       The patterns and letters must be exactly the same, or the output you would get would be wrong. If you were to append one list and not the other, it would break the position of the indexes.
# Q2. letters[-1] always gives the last item. Why is that handier than
#     writing letters[4] when the list keeps growing?
#       Using -1 instead of 4 is more useful when a list keeps growing because 4 will always give the same output, whereas -1 always outputs the last item in the list.
# Q3. .index('C') returns a number. What do you think happens if you call
#     letters.index('Z') when 'Z' is not in the list? (Try it, read the error.)
#       letters.index('Z') gives a ValueError because 'Z' is not in the list.

# -- Encode the word "SOS" using three index lookups -----------------------
# We have no loop yet, so we do each letter explicitly.
# Step 1 is done for you. Do steps 2 and 3 the same way.

s_pattern = patterns[letters.index('S')]    # done for you

decoded_letter   = letters[decoded_position]

# -- YOUR EXTENSION --------------------------------------------------------
# Decode the pattern '...' the same way: find its position in 'patterns',
# then read the matching letter from 'letters'. Print the result.
# (Week 3: a loop will let you decode a whole message at once.)

# TODO: decode the pattern '...' and print the letter

print("=" * 52)

# Using only list operations from Chapter 3 (slices, sorted(), len()):
#
#   1. Print just the FIRST FIVE letters using a slice (letters[:5]).
#   2. Print the LAST THREE patterns using a slice.
#   3. Make an alphabetically SORTED copy of 'letters' with sorted()
#      and confirm the original 'letters' list is unchanged.
#   4. In a comment, explain a danger of parallel lists: if you sorted
#      'letters' but not 'patterns', what would go wrong with lookups?
#      (This is the bug that dictionaries will make impossible in Week 5.)

# TODO: implement the stretch challenge here


# =============================================================================
# CHECKLIST
#   [x] ANCHOR:    ran it; answered Q1-Q3 (including the .index('Z') error)
#   [x] GUIDED:    'SOS' encodes to ['...', '---', '...']
#   [x] EXTENSION: '...' decodes to 'S'
#   [ ] STRETCH:   (optional) slicing + sorted() + the parallel-list danger
#   [x] I can explain why parallel lists are fragile
#
# LOOKING AHEAD — Week 3
#   Next week you learn FOR LOOPS and TUPLES. You'll merge these two lists
#   into ONE list of (letter, pattern) pairs, and a loop will encode an
#   entire message automatically — no more copy-pasting index lookups.
