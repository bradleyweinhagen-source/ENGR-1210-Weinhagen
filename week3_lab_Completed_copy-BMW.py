# Week 3 Lab: Working with Lists (Loops, Tuples, Comprehensions)
# Chapter 4 — Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition
#
# Standalone script. Still no functions and no imports.
# New tools this week: for loops, tuples, range(), list comprehensions.
# (Note: 'if' statements arrive in Week 4 — so this week we encode words
#  that contain only known letters and no spaces. Handling spaces and
#  unknown characters is exactly what next week's 'if' will add.)

# Last week we kept letters and patterns in two separate lists that had to
# stay aligned. This week we pair them up using TUPLES. A tuple is a fixed
# little group of values: ('A', '.-') keeps the letter and its pattern
# locked together so they can never drift apart.
#
# CODEBOOK is now ONE list of (letter, pattern) tuples.

CODEBOOK = [
    ('A', '.-'),   ('B', '-...'), ('C', '-.-.'), ('D', '-..'),  ('E', '.'),
    ('F', '..-.'), ('G', '--.'),  ('H', '....'), ('I', '..'),   ('J', '.---'),
    ('K', '-.-'),  ('L', '.-..'), ('M', '--'),   ('N', '-.'),   ('O', '---'),
    ('P', '.--.'), ('Q', '--.-'), ('R', '.-.'),  ('S', '...'),  ('T', '-'),
    ('U', '..-'),  ('V', '...-'), ('W', '.--'),  ('X', '-..-'), ('Y', '-.--'),
    ('Z', '--..'),
]

# A for loop visits every tuple. We "unpack" each tuple into two names at
# once: letter, pattern. No more index bookkeeping.
print("\nThe full codebook (first 8 rows):")
print(f"  {'Letter':<8}{'Pattern'}")
print("  " + "-" * 18)
for letter, pattern in CODEBOOK[:8]:        # slice: just the first 8
    print(f"  {letter:<8}{pattern}")

print(f"\nThe codebook has {len(CODEBOOK)} entries.")

# -- ANCHOR QUESTIONS ------------------------------------------------------
# Q1. Why is a tuple ('A', '.-') safer here than a list ['A', '.-']?
#     (Hint: what should NEVER change about a codebook entry?)
#       Tuples are safer than lists because their values cannot be changed after they are created.it keeps the codes and patterns paired preventing erros unlike lists.
# Q2. "for letter, pattern in CODEBOOK" unpacks each tuple into two names.
#     How is that different from "for entry in CODEBOOK"?
#       for entry in codebook keeps the tuple paired, whereas letter, pattern unpacks the tuple into two separate variables.
# Q3. CODEBOOK[:8] is a slice. What would CODEBOOK[-3:] give you?
#       Changing the slice from 8 to -3 will make it start at the third-to-last item and include everything to the end.

print("\n" + "=" * 52)
print("SECTION 2: GUIDED — Encode a Whole Word with a Loop")
print("=" * 52)

# We keep the parallel lists too, because the quickest no-'if' lookup is
# still letters.index(). A LOOP now does for a whole word what you did by
# hand last week.
letters  = [pair[0] for pair in CODEBOOK]   # comprehension: pull out letters
patterns = [pair[1] for pair in CODEBOOK]   # comprehension: pull out patterns

word = "HELLO"          # only known letters, no spaces (see header note)

encoded = []
# TODO: loop over each character in 'word'. For each one, find its position
#       with letters.index(character), grab patterns[position], and append
#       that to 'encoded'.
# Hint:
#   for character in word:
#       position = letters.index(character)
#       encoded.append(patterns[position])

# (write your loop here)
for character in word:
    word = letters.index(character)
    encoded.append(patterns[word])

print(f"\nEncoding '{word}':")

# Expected once complete: ['....', '.', '.-..', '.-..', '---']

# SECTION 3 — EXTENSION
# =============================================================================
print("\n" + "=" * 52)
print("SECTION 3: EXTENSION — Comprehensions and Why Lookup Is Slow")
print("=" * 52)

# A list comprehension can filter while it builds. Worked example: collect
# the patterns for all the VOWELS in one line.
vowel_patterns = [pattern for (letter, pattern) in CODEBOOK if letter in 'AEIOU']
print(f"\nVowel patterns (A,E,I,O,U): {vowel_patterns}")

# -- YOUR EXTENSION --------------------------------------------------------
# Every lookup above scans the lists from the start until it finds a match.
# Show how slow that can get: use a loop to count how many tuples Python
# must check before it reaches 'Z' (the last letter).
# Hint: start a counter at 0; loop over CODEBOOK adding 1 each time; you
#       can stop early with 'break' once letter == 'Z'.
# (Week 5: a dictionary finds any letter in ONE step, no scanning.)

# TODO: count and print the number of comparisons needed to reach 'Z'
count = 0
for letter, pattern in CODEBOOK:
   count += 1


print(count)

# SECTION 4 — STRETCH
# =============================================================================
print("\n" + "=" * 52)
print("SECTION 4: STRETCH — Codebook Statistics")
print("=" * 52)

# Using loops and/or comprehensions only:
#   1. Find the SHORTEST pattern(s) and the LONGEST pattern(s) in the
#      codebook, and which letters they belong to. (len() of each pattern.)
#   2. Compute the AVERAGE pattern length across all 26 letters.
#   3. Use range(len(CODEBOOK)) to print the codebook as a numbered list:
#         1. A  .-
#         2. B  -...
#      (This is the index-based loop style from p. 60-62.)

# TODO: implement the stretch challenge here


# =============================================================================
# CHECKLIST
#   [x] ANCHOR:    ran the codebook table; answered Q1-Q3
#   [x] GUIDED:    'HELLO' encodes to ['....', '.', '.-..', '.-..', '---']
#   [x] EXTENSION: counted the comparisons needed to reach 'Z'
#   [ ] STRETCH:   (optional) shortest/longest/average + numbered list
#   [x] I can explain why linear search gets slower as data grows
#
# LOOKING AHEAD — Week 4
#   Next week you learn IF / ELIF / ELSE. That lets you handle the messy
#   cases this week skipped: spaces between words, lowercase input, and
#   characters that aren't in the codebook at all.
