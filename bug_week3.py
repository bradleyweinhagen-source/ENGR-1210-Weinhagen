# BUG 3
# BUG HINT: Read about numerical list functions or google "Python list built-in functions"
#           You can a total list of built-in functions here: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_functions.asp
#           min(), max(), and sum() are built-in functions.
#           What is the correct syntax for calling a function?
#           Compare how you call a function vs. a list method (e.g. insert or append).

# BUG 4
# BUG HINT:   
# If you see a code pattern you don't recognize, google it!  
# If you don't know the name of it, google "what is this python code called" and copy/paste the code into the search bar.  
# You will find a name for it, and then you can google that name to learn more about it.
