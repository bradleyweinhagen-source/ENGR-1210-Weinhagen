# ENGR1210 — Introduction to Programming
# Morse Code Translator Project
# Week 1 Lab: Variables and Simple Data Types
# Chapter 2 — Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition
#
# HOW THIS FILE WORKS
# =============================================================================
# This file IS your lab. Read it top to bottom. Run it with F5.
# Each section builds on the one before it.
#
# SECTION 1 — ANCHOR      (fully worked — read, run, understand)
# SECTION 2 — GUIDED      (partially complete — fill in the blanks)
# SECTION 3 — EXTENSION   (working code — add a small piece)
# SECTION 4 — STRETCH     (open-ended — design it yourself)
#
# The rule: you must be able to EXPLAIN every line you submit.
# If you can run it but not explain it, you're not done yet.
#
# HOW THIS COURSE IS BUILT  (read this once — it explains everything)
# =============================================================================
# For the next several weeks you will build a Morse code translator as
# a PLAIN SCRIPT — top to bottom, no functions, no imports, no extra
# files. You will use only what the textbook has taught so far:
#
#   Week 1: variables & types     Week 4: if / elif / else
#   Week 2: lists                  Week 5: dictionaries
#   Week 3: loops over lists       Week 6: while loops & input
#
# Then in Week 7 ("Functions"), once you have a working script, you will
# learn to REFACTOR it: wrap the logic in functions and split it into
# modules (separate .py files). That is also when the hardware layer
# appears. You will literally turn the script you are about to start
# into a real, reusable program — and you will understand WHY functions
# exist, because you will have lived without them first.
#
# So when you see a note like "(Week 7: this becomes a function)",
# that is a promise, not a missing piece. For now, write it inline.
#
# THE BIGGER PICTURE
# =============================================================================
#   Text in -> encode -> "LED" blinks -> read signal -> decode -> text out
#
# Week 1 builds the foundation: timing constants and project metadata.
# This week the "LED" is just a printed line. Real hardware comes later.
# =============================================================================

# SECTION 1 — ANCHOR
# Fully worked example. Read every line. Run it. Study the output.
# Then answer the three questions in the comments before moving on.

# -- What is Morse code timing? --------------------------------------------
# Morse code is defined entirely by TIMING RATIOS.
# The dot (.) is the base unit. Everything else is a multiple of it.
#
# ITU-R M.1677 standard ratios:
#   DOT          = 1 unit  (the base)
#   DASH         = 3 units
#   SYMBOL GAP   = 1 unit  (pause between dots/dashes within a letter)
#   LETTER GAP   = 3 units (pause between letters)
#   WORD GAP     = 7 units (pause between words)
#
# We store the base unit in milliseconds so we can tune speed by
# changing ONE variable. Everything else is calculated from it.

DOT_MS        = 50          # base unit: one dot = 100 milliseconds
DASH_MS       = DOT_MS * 3   # a dash is 3 dot durations = 300ms
SYMBOL_GAP_MS = DOT_MS * 1   # gap within a letter = 100ms
LETTER_GAP_MS = DOT_MS * 3   # gap between letters = 300ms
WORD_GAP_MS   = DOT_MS * 7   # gap between words = 700ms

# Print the timing table (just sequential print statements — no loop yet;
# loops arrive in Week 3).
print(f"\nBase unit (DOT_MS): {DOT_MS}ms")
print(f"{'Symbol':<8} {'Duration':>10}ms {'Ratio':>8}")
print("-" * 36)
print(f"{'dot':<8} {DOT_MS:>10}    {'1x':>8}")
print(f"{'dash':<8} {DASH_MS:>10}    {'3x':>8}")
print(f"{'symbol gap':<8} {SYMBOL_GAP_MS:>10}    {'1x':>8}")
print(f"{'letter gap':<8} {LETTER_GAP_MS:>10}    {'3x':>8}")
print(f"{'word gap':<8} {WORD_GAP_MS:>10}    {'7x':>8}")

# -- Our first "LED" -------------------------------------------------------
# For now the LED is just text. In Week 7 this single print becomes a
# function call into a hardware module that you can swap for a real Pico.
print("\n[LED] ON")
print("[LED] OFF")

# -- ANCHOR QUESTIONS (discuss with your partner before continuing) --------
# Q1. Change DOT_MS to 50. What happens to DASH_MS and WORD_GAP_MS?
#     Why does this work without changing any other lines?
#     When changing Dot_MS both Dash_MS and WORD_GAP_MS change to 3x and 7x of 50 instead of 100. 
#     This works without changing any other line because all the other lines use DOT_MS as a base unit and adds a multiple to change it to whats needed.
# Q2. What does the :<15 in the f-string format specifier do?
#     Try changing 15 to 8 and observe what happens to the output.
#     It changes the spacing between parts of the string by 15 spaces. When changing :<15 to :<8, it changes the spacing to 8 spaces, making it look off.
# Q3. Every other timing variable is calculated from DOT_MS instead of
#     being typed in as a fixed number. Why is that safer than writing
#     DASH_MS = 300 directly?
#     This is safer because it reduces the chance for human error when typing numbers.

# SECTION 3 — EXTENSION
# The code below works. Your job: add one small piece using the same style.
# (No functions yet — just variables and arithmetic. Week 7 turns this
#  calculation into a reusable function.)

print("=" * 52)

# -- Existing working code -------------------------------------------------
# How long does it take to send the letter A?  A is dot-dash ( .- ).
# That is: a dot, then a symbol gap, then a dash.
# We add the three durations together with plain arithmetic.

# -- YOUR EXTENSION --------------------------------------------------------
# Calculate the transmission time for the letter U, whose pattern is ..- .
# U is: dot, symbol gap, dot, symbol gap, dash.
# Build it the same way: one variable per part, then add them up.
# Finally, print the breakdown and the total, like the example above.
#
# (Week 7: you will replace this hand-counting with a function that
#  takes ANY pattern string and loops over it. For now, do it by hand —
#  it makes the function you write later much easier to understand.)

# SECTION 4 — STRETCH
# No starter code. No hints. Design it yourself.
# This section is optional but strongly recommended.
# =============================================================================

print("\n" + "=" * 52)
print("SECTION 4: STRETCH — Words-Per-Minute Speed")
print("=" * 52)

# -- Challenge -------------------------------------------------------------
# Morse speed is measured in WPM (words per minute). The standard test
# word "PARIS" takes exactly 50 dot units to send, which gives:
#
#       WPM = 1200 / DOT_MS        (when DOT_MS is in milliseconds)
#
# Using ONLY variables and arithmetic (no functions, no loops yet):
#
#   1. Calculate the current WPM from DOT_MS and print it nicely,
#      e.g. "At DOT_MS=100, speed is 12 WPM".
#
#   2. Suppose you want to send at 5 WPM. Rearrange the formula to find
#      the DOT_MS you would need, and print it. (Check: 5 WPM -> 240ms.)
#
#   3. Print a small "speed card" of three fixed speeds using separate
#      print lines (one each for 5, 12, and 20 WPM) showing the DOT_MS
#      for each. (Week 3, with loops, you'll turn this into a real table.)
#
# Bonus: change DOT_MS at the top of the file from 100 to 50 and re-run.
# Confirm your WPM line updates automatically. Why does it?

# TODO: implement the stretch challenge here


# =============================================================================
# WHAT I BUILT THIS WEEK — Checklist
# =============================================================================
#   [ ] ANCHOR:    I ran the anchor code and can explain every line
#   [ ] ANCHOR:    I answered all three anchor questions
#   [ ] GUIDED:    All metadata variables are filled in and correctly typed
#   [ ] GUIDED:    The banner prints with my name and correct values
#   [ ] EXTENSION: The letter U transmission time prints correctly
#   [ ] STRETCH:   (optional) WPM speed calculations implemented
#   [ ] I can explain my code to a partner without looking at it
#
# =============================================================================
# LOOKING AHEAD — Week 2
# =============================================================================
# Next week you learn LISTS, and you'll store the Morse codebook — every
# letter and its dot/dash pattern — as a list. Keep this file: your
# DOT_MS timing constants carry forward into the whole project.
#
# And remember the promise: in Week 7 the inline calculations you wrote
# this week become reusable FUNCTIONS, and the project splits into MODULES.
